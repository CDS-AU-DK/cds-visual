# Session 1 - What is an image?

## Overview

In today's coding session, we'll be doing two things.

Firsty, we'll be finishing off the Github material from Wednesday which was not possible due to UCloud troubles.

After that, we'll be starting to do some introductory Python stuff. 

We'll be working with the scientific computing library, ```numpy```, and introducing the image processing tool ```Open-CV``` if we have time.


## Tasks

- Setting up [UCloud](https://cloud.sdu.dk)
    - Introducing Coder Python
    - Getting UCloud and Github to play nicely
      - Generating an [access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token)
- ```numpy``` for working with arrays
- ```Open-CV``` for simple image processing
