# Session 2 - Basic Image Processing with Python

## Overview

Today in the lecture, we looked at colour channels in a bit more depth. We also started thinking about how we can start to use the information contained in these colour channels to say things about images.

The kind of information we can extract from colour channels is the intesity of each colour present in a given pixel. By clustering values together we can create histograms, visualisations which show us how many of any given pixel intesity there is in an image.

In this code-along session, we'll see how to construct simple histograms using ```OpenCV```.
