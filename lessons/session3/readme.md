# Session 3 - More image processing with ```OpenCV```

## Overview

Over the past couple of weeks, we've begun to see how we can do increasingly sophisticated things with image processing functionality in ```OpenCV```.

Today, we're going to keep building on those skills and seeing a few more tricks and techniques we can use when processing images. We'll be focusing on:

- Translating and rotating
- Drawing and masking
- Comparing colour histograms

By the end of today, you should be able to start making quantitative comparisons about images using their colour histograms and building a very rudimentary image search algortithm. This will actually form the basis of Assignment 1 for your *Visual Analytics* portfolio.
